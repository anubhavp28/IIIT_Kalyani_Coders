# FOR HACK-A-BIT HACKATHON 2018 

## News Aggregator That Helps Mitigate The Effects of Media Bias on Users.

<b>6th highest ranked hack at HACK-A-BIT 2018. I was part of the only single-memeber team selected for HACK-A-BIT 2018. </b> 

I admit, the code quality is poor, but in my defence, I was bounded by time - it was created under 36-hour. 

## Description
For HACK-A-BIT Hackathon 2018, I created a News Aggregator that uses Machine Learning to check news articles for biased content. It furthur, utilises sentiment analysis to understand the type of bias - 'positive' or 'negative'. Any news search made through the app, returns news articles along with their classification, and if a certain news article is found to be biased, the app provides the users, with additonal news articles providing a different perspective. The app also offers functionality to analyse a news article by it's URL.
